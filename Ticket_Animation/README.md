# Ticket_Animation

Hero Animation Mock for Air Ticket from Dribbble

Started this project as a design mock up for Air Ticket Animation
**Design: ** - https://dribbble.com/shots/5850392-Dynamic-boarding-pass-interface

- In this design, you will see how the **common UI layouts** are created and how **hero animations** take place. In addition to this, you will also see how you can **customize the transition** between screen switching. Also, you will be introduced to a new library **after_layout**, which is essential if you want to perform some tasks after the layout has first drawn itself.
